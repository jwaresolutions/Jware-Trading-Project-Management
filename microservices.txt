Trading Algorithm Service: This service will host your trading algorithms. These algorithms can be based on machine learning, sentiment analysis, and complex algorithmic predictions to analyze millions of data points and execute trades at the optimal price. You can also consider using algo trading or trading robots, which are computer codes that identify buy and sell signals.

Trade Execution Service: This service will be responsible for executing trades based on the signals received from the Trading Algorithm Service. This service should be able to interact with your brokerage account to place trades.

Backtesting Service: This service will allow you to test your trading algorithms on historical data to evaluate their performance before deploying them in the live market.

Monitoring and Alerting Service: This service will monitor the performance of your trading system and alert you in case of any issues or significant market events.

Complex Event Processing (CEP) System: This system will detect profit-making opportunities in real-time. It comprises four parts: CEP engine, CEP rules, CEP WS, and CEP result interface.

Portfolio Management Service: This service will manage your investment portfolio. It will ensure that your portfolio delivers the right initiatives at the right time to achieve the expected outcomes. It will also fit within the portfolio lifecycle, which includes the traditional view of portfolio risk management.

Risk Tolerance Service: This service will assess your risk tolerance, which is a measure of the degree of loss you're willing to endure within your portfolio. It will consider several factors to determine the level of risk you can afford to take, which will drive how you invest. This service can use a risk-profiling questionnaire to assess your risk tolerance. It will also consider your investment horizon, i.e., the amount of time between when you invest and when you need to spend the proceeds of your investments.
